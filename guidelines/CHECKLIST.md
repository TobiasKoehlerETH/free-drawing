# Drawing Verification Checklist

Flat, testable checklist derived from the topic guides in this folder. Used by the optical feedback loop as the rubric when auditing an exported PNG.

Every item is a binary PASS / FAIL with visible evidence.

- [ ] E.8 Repeated features use `2×`, `4×`, `TYP`, or similar multiplicity.
- [ ] E.9 Boxed theoretically exact and parenthesized reference dimensions have the correct non-direct-tolerance meaning.
- [ ] E.10 Dimension lines, leaders, and value text do not overlap each other.
- [ ] E.11 No controlling dimension appears more than once on the sheet.

## F. Tolerances & Fits - [guideline 05](05-tolerances-general-and-fits.md)

- [ ] F.1 A selected general or individual tolerance scheme defines the requirements; legacy `mK` is reviewed and ISO 22081 has values, scope and datums.
- [ ] F.2 Fit callouts use correct case: uppercase for holes, lowercase for shafts.
- [ ] F.3 Deviation style is consistent: `±`, unilateral, limit, or fit code.
- [ ] F.4 Reference dimensions are clearly non-controlling.
- [ ] F.5 Basic dimensions are boxed and paired with GD&T where required.

## G. GD&T - [guideline 06](06-gdt.md)

- [ ] G.1 Title block declares `ISO 8015` when GD&T is used.
- [ ] G.2 Feature control frames read left-to-right with symbol, value, modifier, and datums.
- [ ] G.3 Datum letters are clearly attached to real datum features.
- [ ] G.4 `Ⓜ` or `Ⓛ` is placed after the tolerance value when used.
- [ ] G.5 `Ø` is shown only for cylindrical or spherical zones.

## H. Surface Texture - [guideline 07](07-surface-texture.md)

- [ ] H.1 Surface symbols use parameter + value notation.
- [ ] H.2 The parameter name is explicit (`Ra`, `Rz`, etc.).
- [ ] H.3 Local surface notes override a clear general default.
- [ ] H.4 Bar and circle variants match process intent.
- [ ] H.5 Lay is specified where the surface function depends on it.

## I. Welding - [guideline 08](08-welding.md)

- [ ] I.1 Weld symbols, if used, declare the intended ISO system.
- [ ] I.2 Arrow-side / other-side placement is correct.
- [ ] I.3 Size and length / pitch are placed on the correct sides of the symbol.

## J. Threads & Machining - [guideline 09](09-machining-threads.md)

- [ ] J.1 Internal and external thread graphics are not swapped.
- [ ] J.2 Thread family, size, pitch or TPI, and class are complete.
- [ ] J.3 `LH`, depth, or `THRU` is stated when applicable.
- [ ] J.4 Pipe thread family is explicit where sealing depends on it.
- [ ] J.5 Counterbores, countersinks, spotfaces, and thread reliefs are called out when function requires them.

## K. Material & Processes - [guideline 10](10-material-and-heat-treatment.md)

- [ ] K.1 Material callout is present and unambiguous.
- [ ] K.2 Heat-treatment notes state target hardness or case depth where relevant.
- [ ] K.3 Coatings or finishing steps state class / color / thickness where needed.
- [ ] K.4 Masked or no-coat zones are identified when the process requires them.

## L. Revisions - [guideline 11](11-revisions.md)

- [ ] L.1 Title block revision matches the latest revision row.
- [ ] L.2 Revision table contains index, description, date, and approval fields.
- [ ] L.3 Revision balloons are present for changed areas.

## M. BOM - [guideline 12](12-bom.md)

- [ ] M.1 Assembly drawings include a readable parts list.
- [ ] M.2 Item numbers match balloons.
- [ ] M.3 Standard parts are clearly identified.

## N. Symbols & Notes - [guidelines 13-14](13-symbols-and-notation.md), [14-edges-and-notes.md](14-edges-and-notes.md)

- [ ] N.1 Symbol usage is internally consistent.
- [ ] N.2 General notes define defaults; local leadered notes override only the pointed feature.
- [ ] N.3 Edge-break or deburr rule is stated globally or locally where sharp edges matter.
- [ ] N.4 Critical seating or sealing edges use explicit chamfer or radius callouts instead of vague `deburr`.

## O. Sheet Metal Bends - [guideline 15](15-sheet-metal-bends.md)

- [ ] O.1 Bend direction, angle, and inside radius are clear.
- [ ] O.2 Bend order is shown where sequence matters.
- [ ] O.3 Relief is present where material would otherwise tear or bulge.
- [ ] O.4 Flat-pattern basis is stated when non-default bend data is required.

## P. Project Overrides

- [ ] P.1 Dimension text is not duplicated by dual-unit or stacked display formatting.
- [ ] P.2 The exported sheet was regenerated from the current automation pass, not reused from a stale drawing file.
- [ ] P.3 Optional exact-geometry extraction is only treated as valid when it produced real usable annotations; otherwise the drawing relies on the deterministic preview path.
- [ ] P.4 Reference dimensions retain their non-controlling meaning after cleanup.
- [ ] P.5 A duplicate-dimension dedupe pass ran before completion, and any remaining ambiguous duplicates were flagged for review.
